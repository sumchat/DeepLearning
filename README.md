## DeepLearning
This includes projects in Python using Numpy, Pandas, Scikit Learn and Tensor Flow

## Bike Sharing
This project uses a Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshares users on a given day. The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

## Image Classification
This project uses a convolutional Neural Network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.   

## Generate TV Scripts
This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network to generate a TV script. The neural network is trained  using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network  build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

## Generate Faces
This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks to generate new images of faces

## Translation
Uses a Neural Network to translate from English to French. Here  a sequence to sequence model is trained on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.
